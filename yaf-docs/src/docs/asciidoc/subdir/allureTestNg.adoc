==== Allure Test NG integration

Due to the fact that the framework uses a large number of wrappers and special hooks, they all end up in the base report and thus clutter it up.

===== How to

====== How to use

To exclude unnecessary methods from the report, a special annotation `@SkipReport` is used.

//TODO: does not work
====== Example
[source, java]
----
    @SkipReport
    @BeforeClass
    public void skipReportBeforeClass(ITestContext testContext) {
        super.beforeClass(testContext);
    }
----

====== How it works

There is a special aspect in the module that intercepts the execution of methods in the standard TestNG adapter, and if a method is marked with this annotation, it is "skipped" (not included in the report).
