==== Selenide integration

To integrate YAF and https://selenide.org/[Selenide], `SelenideDriverManager` class is used.
Its main task is to listen to a driver creation event and, if it is a web driver, pass it to the Selenide driver repository.

Also, in case of selenide, in order for `YafLocatorFactory` #(! ссылка на доку# to work correctly, you must skip processing `SelenideElement` on the page.
